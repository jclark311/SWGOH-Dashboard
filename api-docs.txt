Game Data
Localized Units List
Create a localized index of units, with baseId for mapping to unit.defId
Matching rarity:7 reduces results to one defintion per unit

/swgoh/data
Payload: {
    "collection": "unitsList",
    "language": "eng_us",
    "enums":true,
    "match": {
    	"rarity": 7
    },
    "project": {
        "baseId": 1,
        "nameKey": 1,
        "descKey": 1,
        "forceAlignment": 1,
        "categoryIdList": 1,
        "combatType": 1
    }
}
Localized Skills List
Create a localized index of skills and abilities, for mapping to skill.id
Player profiles use a skillId, which maps to an abilityId for localizations... in this case, we need to fetch two (2) lists to provide mapping for skill names

/swgoh/data
Payload: {
    "collection": "skillList",
    "language": "eng_us",
    "enums":true,
    "project": {
        "id":1,
        "abilityReference":1,
        "isZeta":1
    }
}
From this list, we can now map unit.skillId => skillList.id

/swgoh/data
Payload: {
    "collection": "abilityList",
    "language": "eng_us",
    "enums":true,
    "project": {
        "id":1,
        "type":1,
        "nameKey":1
    }
}
From this list, we can now access localized names by mapping skillList.abilityReference => abilityList.id

Localized Gear List
Create a localized index of gear for mappint to unit.equipped

/swgoh/data
Payload: {
    "collection": "equipmentList",
    "language": "eng_us",
    "enums":true,
    "project": {
        "id": 1,
        "nameKey": 1
    }
}
